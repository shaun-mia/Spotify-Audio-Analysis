## Project Setup
### Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set plot style
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
```

### Load Data
```python
# Upload files
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

# Load datasets
df_tracks = pd.read_csv('tracks.csv')
df_genre = pd.read_csv('SpotifyFeatures.csv')
```

## Data Cleaning
1. **Handle Missing Values**: Dropped rows with missing values in essential columns.
2. **Convert Data Types**: Converted release dates to datetime and created binary encoding for the mode column.
3. **Convert Duration**: Transformed durations from milliseconds to seconds.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This section includes summary statistics and visualizations of the data.

### Summary Statistics
```python
print(df_tracks.describe())
print(df_genre.describe())
```

## Visualizations
